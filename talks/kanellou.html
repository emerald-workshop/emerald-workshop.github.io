            <p>In this talk, we will study the power of software combining in achieving recoverable synchronization and designing persistent data structures. Software combining is a general synchronization approach, which attempts to simulate the ideal world when executing synchronization requests (i.e., requests that must be executed in mutual exclusion). Software combining has been shown to significantly decreases the synchronization cost and outperforms many other synchronization techniques in various cases. We will present two recoverable software combining protocols, satisfying different progress properties, that are many times faster and have much lower persistence cost than a large collection of previously-presented  persistent techniques  for achieving scalable synchronization. We build fundamental recoverable data structures, such as stacks and queues, based on these protocols that outperform existing recoverable implementations of such data structures. We also provide the first recoverable implementation of a concurrent heap and present experiments to show that it has good performance when the size of the heap is not very large.</p>
