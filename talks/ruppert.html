            <p>We study the ability of different shared object types to solve recoverable consensus using non-volatile shared memory in a system with crashes and recoveries. In particular, we compare the difficulty of solving recoverable consensus to the difficulty of solving the standard wait-free consensus problem in a system with halting failures. We focus on the model where individual processes may crash and recover and on the large class of object types that are equipped with a read operation. We provide a characterization of the readable object types that can solve recoverable consensus among a given number of processes.  (In his PODC 2024 paper, Ovens showed that our characterization is exact.) Using this characterization, we show that the number of processes that can solve consensus using a readable type can be larger than the number of processes that can solve recoverable consensus using that type, but only slightly larger. </p>
