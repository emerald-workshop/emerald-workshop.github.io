            <p>As computation moves increasingly towards the cloud, making guarantees to end-users about the confidentiality and integrity of their applications and data is an important primitive. Unfortunately, this is difficult to achieve given the vulnerability of memory devices to corruption-based attacks that exploit physical device properties. In this talk, I will present secure memory, a protocol that allows memory architectures to make these guarantees. In doing so, I will describe the challenges posed by emerging non-volatile memories and disaggregated memory topologies, such as CXL, on the secure memory protocol and how our work reconciles these challenges.</p>
