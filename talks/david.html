            <p>Traditionally, algorithmic design in systems that use I/O, both for communicating with other machines and for accessing storage, has focused exclusively on reducing I/O costs, paying little attention to optimization in other parts of the system. This was motivated by the extremely high cost of I/O, which formed the bottleneck in any system that used it. </p><p>
                However, recent hardware trends have seen I/O speeds increase at a much higher rate than CPU speeds. Thus, it is now possible for distributed systems that use messages and access storage to bottleneck on the CPU.</p>
                <p>In this talk, I will discuss how this hardware trend affects concurrency control in transactional memory, in particular in distributed transactional systems, and, time permitting, on-disk transactional databases.
