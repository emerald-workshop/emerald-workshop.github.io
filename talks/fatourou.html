            <p>In this talk, we present fundamental persistence principles, crucial for performance, that an algorithmâ€™s designer has to take into consideration when designing persistent data structures. We illustrate the performance power of respecting these principles, when designing fundamental data structures, such as stacks and queues. </p><p>
                The talk will also provide a methodology for analyzing the cost of persistence instructions, not by simply counting them but by separating them into categories based on the impact they have on the performance. This analysis reveals that understanding the actual persistence cost of an algorithm in machines with NVM, is more complicated than previously thought, and requires a thorough evaluation, since the performance impact of different persistence instructions may greatly vary.
