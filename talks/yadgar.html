            <p>Storage systems must continuously evolve to take full advantage of new technologies as they emerge. Non-volatile memory has recently become the focus of many such optimization and re-design efforts. In this talk, I will describe some of these efforts to demonstrate the stages of new media adoption: from ensuring backwards compatibility and easy deployment, through identifying and addressing media-specific bottlenecks, to rethinking the core interfaces of the system. These stages have been followed in the adoption of several past technologies, for surprisingly many years!
