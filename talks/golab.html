            <p>Persistent memory (PMem) marries the low latency of DRAM with the durability of secondary storage devices, enabling both simpler and faster data-intensive software applications. Recent years witnessed the next evolution of this technology as Intel, in partnership with Micron, developed and commercially released the Optane persistent memory module.  In parallel with these efforts, the Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA) devised a standard programming model for persistent memory, based on the notion that persistent memory is exposed to applications by the operating system through memory-mapped files.  The Compute Express Link (CXL) standard promises to create further opportunities for memory expansion and tiering of persistent memory across devices.</p>
                <p>The emergence of novel high-density persistent memories upends some long-standing traditions in distributed computing theory, such as the strong emphasis on parallelism over fault tolerance in the design of in-memory data structures and synchronization primitives. In this talk, I will discuss the impact of the modern PMem-empowered memory hierarchy on research in distributed computing theory, particularly in the area of shared memory algorithms.</p>
