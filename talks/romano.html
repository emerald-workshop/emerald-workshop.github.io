            <p>Processing-In-Memory (PIM) is a novel computing architecture that augments existing DRAM memory chips with lightweight logic. By allowing to offload computations to the PIM system, this approach aims at avoiding the data-bottleneck problem that affects many modern workloads. This talk addresses the challenge of creating efficient software implementations of the Transactional Memory (TM) abstraction by presenting PIM-STM, a library offering a variety of TM implementations for UPMEM, one of the first commercial PIM systems. Through an extensive analysis, we evaluate the efficiency of different TM algorithm design choices on this emerging architecture. Additionally, we measure the impact of utilizing various memory tiers within the UPMEM system, each with different latency and capacity trade-offs, to store the metadata for different TM implementations. Finally, we demonstrate the performance and memory efficiency gains achievable by using PIM-STM to accelerate TM applications originally designed for conventional CPU-based systems.</p>
