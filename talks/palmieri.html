            <p>Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) is a networking technology that allows a machine to access the memory of another machine directly without exchanging messages and with performance significantly faster than legacy networking infrastructures. The RDMA programming model resembles shared memory, which is appealing because it increases the programmability of distributed concurrent applications. In practice, developing high-performance, scalable systems using RDMA is still an open challenge. This talk focuses on two well-known issues when building RDMA-enabled distributed concurrent applications. First, the absence of atomicity between shared-memory APIs and RDMA APIs mandates using loopback channels, which affects performance and parallelism. Second, the difficulty of increasing the size of the distributed system due to the limited resources available on the RDMA cards hampers scalability. In the talk, a solution for each of these issues is discussed, and future directions are presented. </p>
