<!-- # 1st Workshop on Distributed Computing with Emerging Hardware Technology -->

<!-- ### In conjunction with [PODC'24](https://www.podc.org/podc2024/), Nantes, France, June 17-21, 2024 -->

### June 21th, 2024. Colocated with [PODC'24](https://www.podc.org/podc2024/) and [SPAA'24](https://spaa.acm.org/). Nantes, France.

## Overview and scope

EMERALD aims at investigating how the utilization of future and emerging hardware technology can influence (or add to) the foundations of concurrent and distributed computing. The workshop will host a series of invited talks which will contribute to the better understanding of how such technology could change what we know about concurrent and distributed algorithms and models. The emphasis will be on persistent memory computing, NUMA-aware computing, distributed computing in systems with Remote Direct Memory Accesses (RDMA), distributed and concurrent computing on top of heterogeneous hardware, processing in memory (PIM), near-memory processing (NMP), disaggregated/composable systems, and others. 
The topics covered by EMERALD specialize the following broader topics for systems that feature modern, emerging or future hardware technology:

- concurrency, synchronization, and persistence 
- design and analysis of concurrent and distributed algorithms
- distributed and concurrent data structures
- fault-tolerance, self-organization, and self-stabilization
- lower bounds and impossibility results for distributed computing
- multiprocessor and multi-core architectures and algorithms
- transactional memory

Through a carefully-chosen collection of invited talks, EMERALD aspires to reveal realistic and practical aspects that can positively influence theory research, in whatever regards the choice of the problems to work on, the right level of abstraction to study them, how to come up with realistic models for computation, how to efficiently support additional desirable features (persistence, NUMA-awareness, architecture-specific design) when designing concurrent and distributed algorithms, while maintaining or improving their performance characteristics, etc. 
EMERALD will be a full-day event.  In addition to hosting lectures by invited speakers, it will feature an open discussion session aiming at highlighting important problems for future research.
