# 1st Workshop on Distributed Computing with Emerging Hardware Technology (EMERALD)

### November 21th, 2023 (full day event)

### In conjunction with [PODC'24](https://www.podc.org/podc2024/), Nantes, France, June 17-21, 2024


## Overview and scope

EMERALD aims at investigating how the utilization of future and emerging hardware technology can
influence (or add to) the foundations of concurrent and distributed computing. The workshop will host a
series of invited talks which will contribute to the better understanding of how such technology could
change what we know about concurrent and distributed algorithms and models. The emphasis will be on
persistent memory computing, NUMA-aware computing, distributed computing in systems with Remote
Direct Memory Accesses (RDMA), distributed and concurrent computing on top of heterogeneous
hardware, processing in memory (PIM), near-memory processing (NMP), disaggregated/composable
systems, and others.

The topics covered by EMERALD are of high relevance to the scope of PODC. In particular, they specialize
the following broader topics of interest listed in the PODC CFP, for systems that feature modern, emerging
or future hardware technology:

- concurrency, synchronization, and persistence
- design and analysis of concurrent and distributed algorithms
- distributed and concurrent data structures
- fault-tolerance, self-organization, and self-stabilization
- lower bounds and impossibility results for distributed computing
- multiprocessor and multi-core architectures and algorithms
- transactional memory

Through a carefully-chosen collection of invited talks, EMERALD aspires to reveal realistic and practical
aspects that can positively influence theory research, in whatever regards the choice of the problems to
work on, the right level of abstraction to study them, how to come up with realistic models for
computation, how to efficiently support additional desirable features (persistence, NUMA-awareness,
architecture-specific design) when designing concurrent and distributed algorithms, while maintaining or
improving their performance characteristics, etc.
